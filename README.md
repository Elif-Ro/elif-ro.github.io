# Happy Birthday my sweet baby<3

To the most beautiful and loving Man, who I adore and appreciate for always I exist

Happy Birthday to ur 33 Birthday my most beautiful sweet Abudim I know, we dont have it always easy, but know that no matter what comes and awaits us in the future, that I'll never let u down and leave u<3 Im so proud for the man u r today and I love u with all my heart and being<3

I love u to the moon and back my sweet baby<3

Since we I cant give it to u in person, have these flowers and always know, how much I think of u and appreaciate u for the person u r<3

U r my first and only love<3 

Ur existence will always be the evidence on how precious and loving the meaning of life actually is.
Ur eyes as deep and dark as the wide night sky and yet so gentle and soft as the moonlight that hits the surface from the ocean. 
Ur hair as brown as trees that have finally touched the warm sunlight after a long cold winter.
Ur lips as sweet as soft as the first blooming flowers in spring after the snow has melted off of them and they can finally lift their to the wide blue sky.
Ur hands as strong as it might seem and some might think they r there to hold on no matter what, yet I believe they have been created for the purpose that they can be held, taken care off and softly touched.

Ya my heart, my love, my dear, my lovely precious King, my sweet King... with so many different names I have called u already.  
Even our Creater has become fond of u as I always start and end my prayers with and for u<3

I'm naive, I do mistakes, I have no experience in love nor in Life. I barely saw the World... yet believe me when I tell u, In u I see everything and more.
From the sad man once, left alone in shambles, the second  heard u, I cant describe u but I saw a hand reaching out to me, a heart holding itself back and soul not daring to look. I took it upon my life, I swore many many many times to Allah swt, "I will support and love this man no matter what, I wont let him down" 

I have so many more things I could tell u, please understand, when u asked me if the world stopps spinning if we stopped being together, ya my heart is with u since the day I met u. No matter how hard it gets, It always screams after ur name and not even a blink and I see my soul searching for u.

Therefore, Congratulations my love<3 To the amazing man u have become and still grow to. 
In good as in bad times, I'll always hold to u.
Im so proud of u. 

May we be each others lovers, biggest supporters and Partners here and the after<3
